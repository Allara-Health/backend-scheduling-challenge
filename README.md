# Allara's Scheduling system

**Overview**

This project is a telehealth scheduling system designed to manage and optimize telehealth appointments for healthcare providers. The current implementation includes a backend server built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with React.

**Current Code Setup**

_Backend (Node.js with Express)_	
- Server Setup: The backend server listens on port 3001 and provides APIs to manage healthcare providers and their schedules.
- Endpoints:
  - GET `/providers`: Retrieve all providers.
  - POST `/providers`: Add a new provider.
  - GET `/schedule`: Get the appointment schedule for all providers.

_Frontend (React)_
- Components: The frontend includes components to display the list of providers, add a new provider, and view the schedule.
- API Integration: The frontend communicates with the backend using fetch requests to manage providers and schedules.

We would like you to build upon the existing system to help our concierge team. 

**Implement Additional Functionality:**

1. Edit Provider:
- Create a new PUT endpoint /providers/:id to handle updating a provider's details.
- Implement logic to validate the incoming data and update the provider in the database or in-memory storage.
2. Delete Provider:
- Create a new DELETE endpoint /providers/:id to handle removing a provider.
- Implement logic to remove the provider from the database or in-memory storage.
3. Improve Error Handling:
- Implement more robust error handling for all existing and new endpoints.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different scenarios (e.g., provider not found, invalid input data).
4. Input Validation:
- Add input validation for all endpoints that accept data (POST and PUT).
- Ensure that required fields are present and have valid formats (e.g., time format for availability).
5. Logging:
- Implement logging for important actions and errors to aid in debugging and monitoring.

Feel free to approach these in whatever order you would like, but we'd love for you to discuss your approach and any product considerations with us before you start coding!
